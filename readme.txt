SEO Images Reloaded automatically adds alt and title attributes to all your images to increase traffic from search engines.

== Description ==

SEO Images Reloaded is a Wordpress SEO plugin which automatically updates all images with proper ALT and TITLE attributes for SEO (search engine optimization). If your images do not have ALT and TITLE already set, SEO Images Reloaded will add them according the options you set.

The ALT attribute is an important part of search engine optimization. It describes your images to search engines and when users search for images this is a key determining factor for a match. 

The TITLE attribute play a lesser role but is important for visitors as this text will automatically appear in the tooltip when their mouse is hovering over the image.

Supported tags:

- %file_name% - image file name (without extension)
- %post_title% - post title
- %author% - post author
- %category% - first post category
- %categories% - all post categories
- %tag% - first post tag
- %tags% - all post tags
- %media_title% - image title in media library
- %media_caption% - image caption in media library
- %title_attr% - existing title attribute on <img /> tag
- %alt_attr% - existing alt attribute on <img /> tag

This is a fork (an updated clone) of [SEO Friendly Images](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-image/) by [Vladimir Prelovac](http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/). The original plugin had a bug causing it to never add alt or title attributes.
